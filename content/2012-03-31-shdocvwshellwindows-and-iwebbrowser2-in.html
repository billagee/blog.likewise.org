Not too long ago I needed to write some test setup code in C# to check for open IE windows.<br /><br />The idea was to kill any running IE instances before entering the main portion of the test case - and just for reference, I wanted to record the URL that each closed IE window had been viewing.<br /><br />My first thought was to use this common technique:<br /><br /><ul><li>Enumerate the SHDocVw.ShellWindows collection, looking for IE processes</li><li>Use IE's IWebBrowser2 COM interface to interact with any IE instances found</li></ul><br />Turns out this is a common question for C# projects - and there seem to be some overly convoluted solutions floating around.<br /><br />However, one solution is quite easy - the key point is that the friendly name of the SHDocVw type library is "Microsoft Internet Controls".<br /><br />So, if you add a reference to the "Microsoft Internet Controls" COM component in your C# project, you'll be able to use SHDocVw.ShellWindows and SHDocVw.IWebBrowser2.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YmU9w_7HzlY/T3dEOiDNgOI/AAAAAAAAAFs/FGsLpmxifFo/s1600/ms_int_controls.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="271" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YmU9w_7HzlY/T3dEOiDNgOI/AAAAAAAAAFs/FGsLpmxifFo/s320/ms_int_controls.png" /></a></div><br />This example code shows how to access the IWebBrowser2 interface of each running IE:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2267093.js?file=gistfile1.cs"></script><br /><br />Full disclosure - I also wrote a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6530083/cannot-add-c-windows-system32-shdocvw-dll-to-my-project/8541532#8541532">stackoverflow answer about this topic</a>.</div>
