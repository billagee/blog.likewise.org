New year, new hosting stack! This blog is now brought to you by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, hosted on Amazon S3, instead of Blogger.

After spending some quality time with the tools I used in the move from Blogger (Octopress, S3, Route 53, git), I feel like the proverbial new pair of glasses has descended and shown me a new world.

So what are the benefits of Octopress? To list just a few:

- <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/">Solarized syntax highlighting built in</a>. This was all I had to hear to get really interested.
- Easy editing of posts in the editor of your choice, using markdown, instead of wrestling the blogger tools.
- Cheap! For my minimal custom domain hosting needs, S3/Route 53 costs should be super low.
- Applying third-party themes is super easy, should you get the urge to <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">check out alternatives</a>.
- Storing everything in a git repo is painless, so no worries when playing around with new themes, or making other significant edits. In blogger-land this didn't feel anywhere near as easy.

To sum up, maintaining this blog just became a lot more enjoyable.
