Lately I've been looking for reasons to use [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/) for diagramming.

And with the steps to set up static web hosting in S3 (as mentioned in my last post) still fresh in mind, it seems like a good time to document what I did. And the steps are simple enough that a diagram might just be enough to cover the important bits.

So here it is - someday it'll be interesting to look back on this and see what's easier/more streamlined in this process, and what remains the same:
